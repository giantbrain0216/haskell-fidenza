# Haskell Fidenza
A partial implementation of [Tyler Hobbs's Fidenza Algorithm](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza), written in Haskell. 

## Motivation
Not being into NFTs at all, I've only very recently found out about the Fidenza algorithm, when it was mentioned as a prompt in [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) and I thought it looked wicked, so I read both the [flow field](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields) and [Fidenza](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza) essays on Tyler's website in one breath. For the next couple of days I would find myself thinking about the ideas he mentioned and appreciating more and more how simple and yet clever they were.

That, paired with me only recently getting into this amazing programming language called [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) culminated into what you'll find in this repo.

## Quick run
In the `Usage` section below you can find information about all the arguments, but for the impatient ones, this should be enough to get the default arguments image, saved as `Fidenza.png`

`cabal run Fidenza -O2`

</p>

I've also included a python script - `makeRandomImages.py`, which generates random seeds and creates images from them, so you can leave that running for a while to produce a bunch of images. It was super exciting for me to come back half an hour later and look at everything that's been produced and every time there would be at least a few surprising ones.

Here are a few of my favourite ones

## Disclaimer
There's a couple of things I would like to get out of the way as soon as possible.

### Haskell beginner
Not going into too much depth here, I've only very recently gotten into Haskell and the functional programming paradigm, so I still find it quite hard to move away from the imperative mindset, which leads to some quite sloppy code that you can find here.

### Partial implementation
I say **partial** implementation of the algorithm, as I am missing 2 of the parameters defined in the original Fidenza - spirals and density - and 4 of the colour schemes - dark lifestyle, rose, party time and white mono.

The **spirals** argument is missing, as I couldn't figure out the exact spiral equation. The closest I've gotten (which is not super close as the center still looks quite different) is  

```
a / (theta ^ 0.7), where a = 100
                         0 < theta <= 14 * Pi
```

which is then rotated a bunch of times to fill in the whole image.  
  
You'll find that I do have some images including spirals and those have been produced using the above method. What I did was, take those spirals and convert them to a vector field, which I then passed in to the algorithm using the `FromFile` constructor for the `vectorFieldGenerator` argument, which you can find below. I've stored those vectors in the `spiral.vectors` file if anyone would like to give them a go.

  <img alt="Example of a spiral image" src="github_imgs/spiral.png" width="50%"/>
</p>

The other one is **density**. Judging by the flow fields essay, I presume that circle packing is used when generating the Fidenza curves, but my approach is significantly different and way lazier. I literally try to generate a new completely random curve up to `numGenerationAttempts` times, until one manages to survive enough iterations to get longer than the `minLength` argument. If that sounds like throwing shit at the wall until something sticks, it's because that's the exact mathetmatical intuition behind it.

The result of that generation method is that the density of the ribbons is a bit of a magical combination between the `widths`,`fertilities`,`width`,`height`,`collisionMargin`,`maxCurves`,`minLength` and `numGenerationAttempts` arguments.

For the most part, I've been able to recreate the various scales present in the original Fidenzas without too much tweaking and those are stored as presets in the `scale` simple argument, which you can also read about below.

## Usage
Below is the help string for the executable which contains all the info you need for controlling your Fidenzas.

The section about _Simple Args_ contains the parameters as defined in the original Fidenza and provide the easiest way of controlling the algorithm.

```
A partial implementation of Tyler Hobbs's Fidenza algorithm, written in Haskell.

Partial, as there currently is no support for creating spiral Fidenzas and for intuitive,
deterministic control over the density of Fidenzas.

The control over the density is achieved by tweaking the maximum number of curves and
the curve widths distribution, as if the image is already mostly filled up by shapes
and {numGenerationAttempts} attemps have failed to generate a new random ribbon, then
the algorithm ends.

A lot of arguments are of type distribution, which accepts 3 different kind of parameters:
   - a uniform distribution, specified by a list like so - [1,2,3,4,5,6], where
     each element has an equal probability of being chosen
   - a weighted distribution, specified by making each element a tuple like so:
     [(1,0.5),(2,0.1),(3,0.1),(4,0.1),(5,0.1),(6,0.1)], where the first member of
     each element is the value and the second is the probability of that value being chosen
   - a uniform distribution, specified by a range like so - (1,6,2), where
     the first number is the starting number, the second number is the end number and
     the third number is to step to keep taking from the starting number until you get to
     the end number. So (1,6,2) becomes [1,3,5].

Usage: (./Fidenza|cabal run Fidenza -- ) [ARGS]

      Valid options are:
         - PerlinNoise {frequency} {offset}, where the offset
              is there to allow us to pass negative coordinates
              and still get a result
         - FromFile {filePath}, where the file has the follwoing forma:
              x11 y11 x12 y12 x13 y13 .. x1n y1n

              the m and n numbers are not necessary to be the same as the
              width and height of the image as they will be lerped
         - Horizontal - every point in the vector field returns (1,0)
         - Straight {angle} - every point in the vector field retuns (1,0)
              rotated by {angle}. Default PerlinNoise 0.001 -400

      multiples of PI divided by this parameter. Default 0

   --width - image width. Default 1000

   --widths - the distribution of curve widths. Default (2,60,4)


Simple Args:
  If the simple flags are used, then the arguments accepted are significantly
  simplified and act as switches on defined presets of the arguments above.

  These presets are designed to resemble Tyler Hobbs's parameters as much as possible.

  It's important to note that the presets are evaluated first, and then any of the main
  arguments above, which means preset values can be overwritten by the main arguments.

  For example, the following command will NOT use the 'small' scale as specified by the
  preset, but instead use the widths provided afterwards.

  ./Fidenza --scale small --widths  [80,90]

   --collisionCheck - whether or not to allow collisions
      Valid options are noOverlap, relaxed and anythingGoes.

   --colours - colour scheme
      Valid options are luxe,rad,golfSocks,baked,politique,
      cool,am,whiteOnCream,blackAndWhite and derived+(any of the above).
        e.g. derivedAm or derivedBlackAndWhite.

   --haveMargin - whether we are constrained to the frame or allowed to go outside.

   --outlined - whether to add an outline to each segment.

   --scale - defines the size distribution of the ribbons
      Valid options are small,medium,large,jumbo,jumboXL,microUniform and uniform.

   --shapeAngles - whether the turns in the ribbons are smooth and sharp
      Valid options are curved and sharp..

   --softShapes - whether to draw the shapes with hundreds of small strokes, 
      resulting in a soft, brush like looking stroke. Valid options are yes and no.

   --superBlocks - whether to make the segments along the ribbon square
      Valid options are yes and no.

   --turbulence - how drastic the shape turns are. A more technical explanation 
      is that this parameter controls the frequency of the underlying 
      perlin noise vector field. Valid options are none,low,mid and high.
